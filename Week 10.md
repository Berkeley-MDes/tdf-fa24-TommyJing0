# Crafting Custom AI through Experimental Design on Zerowidth
## Experiment 1 
In this experiment, I tested two different models—GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo—to find the right balance between creativity and consistency. GPT-4 gave me more detailed and thorough responses, while GPT-4 Turbo was noticeably faster. I also played around with the temperature settings. Higher values made the AI more creative, but lower values kept the responses more focused and consistent. Overall, this experiment helped me better understand the trade-offs between speed, detail, and creativity when using these models.
