This week, I completed the project demo video, which includes four experiments and the final LLM tool, the AI Engine Oil Advisor. I opted for an AI voice for the narration as I’ve been feeling a bit unwell. Additionally, I created several slides in Figma and incorporated screenshots to enhance the presentation. The video initially ran a bit long, so I revised it to keep it closer to 3 minutes.

The editing process for the video was straightforward, thanks to my experience with DaVinci Resolve. With the AI-generated voice already prepared, assembling the video was smooth and efficient. I inserted the slides and screenshots into their corresponding time slots, ensuring a cohesive flow. The entire process took about 4 hours, and I added background music at the end, which provided a nice finishing touch.
