# Exploring LLMs on ZeroWidth Plantform 
This week, we began our third project, which focuses on LLMs and utilizes a platform called ZeroWidth. I successfully logged in using the provided invitation link and created my first project, naming it “Tommy’s Project.”

I created my first workflow in ZeroWidth using a simple flow to test how the platform handles prompt inputs and responses from an LLM. I set up a “Single Prompt Input” as the starting node, where users can input their prompt text. This connects to an “OpenAI GPT-4o Mini” node, which processes the input based on predefined instructions and generates a response. Finally, the response flows to an “Output” node that can display the LLM’s output. This workflow allows me to see how prompts are processed through each stage and experiment with different configurations for the LLM responses.

I tested the workflow with a “hello” message, and it worked perfectly, processing through each node as expected.
