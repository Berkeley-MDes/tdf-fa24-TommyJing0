### Grasshopper 
Yes, I did it! This is my first time experimenting with Grasshopper, and I could never have imagined that such a simple design could have so much complexity behind it. In the beginning, I didn’t quite understand why I needed Grasshopper, especially since I could design this phone stand in NX in 10 minutes and probably have it printed out before I'm done with Grasshopper. However, after spending some time working with it and gaining more understanding, I’ve started to appreciate and enjoy the process.
