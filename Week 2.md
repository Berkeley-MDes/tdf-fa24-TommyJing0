This is my Grasshopper concept map, which helps me understand the entire design process. I start with the phone dimensions since that aspect cannot change, and I believe the phone stand should be designed around the phone itself. Next, I focus on designing the stand to create the desired viewing angle. After that, I combine the phone and the stand into a rough render to visualize how they should work together. At this stage, I can go back and address any imperfections or refine the shape of the stand as needed. Once everything looks right, I add environmental elements to make the render more refined, adjusting display settings as necessary. The final stage is production, where the design is realized through 3D printing.

This is not my first time using Rhino, but it is my first time working with Grasshopper. While Grasshopper is new to me, I’m familiar with similar programming environments, having used tools like ComfyUI, Unreal Engine, and DaVinci Resolve before. I began by adjusting the phone's dimensions, considering how the case would affect those measurements. Overall, it was a fun and engaging experience.

Afterward, I experimented with adjusting the viewing angle, which I hadn’t initially considered. It was really cool to see how I could change the shape of the phone stand using just a couple of sliders.

I also tested some extreme scenarios, like positioning the phone vertically at a steep angle to see if the program would warn me about a potential tipping situation — and it did. I traced it back and opened the "Cluster Cell Phone" component, and the calculations/algorithm behind it were really impressive.
