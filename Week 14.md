## Project 4 Progress Update 
For Project 4, YingYing and I decided to shift the focus from “The Meal” to “The Better Fly.” We laser-cut some 1/4” wood in the Maker Space, and I designed custom gears, which were 3D printed using PLA, for the wing-lifting mechanism. The motor driving the wing-lift is a 60 RPM motor with a reduction gear setup, delivering approximately 15 kg (33 lbs) of torque. We decided to use M5 ball joints with M5 rods to lift the wing.
