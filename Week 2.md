### Week 2 - 9/9/2024

This is my Grasshopper concept map, which helps me understand the entire design process. I start with the phone dimensions since that aspect cannot change, and I believe the phone stand should be designed around the phone itself. Next, I focus on designing the stand to create the desired viewing angle. After that, I combine the phone and the stand into a rough render to visualize how they should work together. At this stage, I can go back and address any imperfections or refine the shape of the stand as needed. Once everything looks right, I add environmental elements to make the render more refined, adjusting display settings as necessary. The final stage is production, where the design is realized through 3D printing.
