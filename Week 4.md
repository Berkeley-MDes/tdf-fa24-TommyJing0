This is the concept map that I came up with for the ecosystems of work and productivity. It is separated into two main sections: Digital Tools and Physical Environment, along with a few other essential components, all of which are necessary for creating a productive and well-balanced work ecosystem. I made this because there are a lot of things to take into account in a company once I graduate from my program and enter the workforce. These factors are important to consider when selecting a company because they have a direct impact on comfort, productivity, and job satisfaction.
